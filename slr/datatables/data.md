# <i>SLR with Datatables:</i> Searchable Experience with Your Own Excel File

This page provides a simple, yet powerful, searchable experience for exploring systematic literature reviews (SLR), powered by DataTables (Jardine, 2025).  <b>Your Excel file is processed directly in your browser, ensuring confidentiality.</b>  Research Plymouth does not retrieve or store your data; the Excel file remains entirely within your browser.  <br/> <br/>
To get started, load your Excel worksheet.  The page will automatically process the first sheet, following a simple structure:
<ul>
<li><b>Row 1:</b> Flexible column headers (required). Suggested columns: Author, Year, Title, Abstract, and Keyword.</li>
<li><b>Row 2:</b> <i>(Optional)</i> Column widths (integers) to customize the table's appearance.  For optimal results, the column widths should sum to 100.</li>
<li><b>Remaining Rows:</b> Your data.</li>
</ul>
Please ensure your Excel file is formatted accordingly for optimal results. Enjoy exploring your literature review!
