# Interactive Literature Reviews with DataTables

This page provides a powerful, searchable experience for exploring systematic literature reviews, powered by DataTables.  <b>Your Excel file will be processed directly in your browser, ensuring confidentiality.</b>  Research Plymouth does not retrieve or store your data; the Excel file stays entirely within your browser.<br/>
To get started, load your Excel worksheet.  The page will automatically process the first sheet of your file, following a simple structure:<br/>
-<b>Row 1:</b>Flexible column headers (required). Suggested columns: Author, Year, Abstract, and Keyword.<br/>
-<b>Row 2:</b>(Optional): Column widths (integers) to customize the table's appearance.  For optimal results, the column widths should sum to 100.<br/>
-<b>Remaining Rows:</b>Your data.<br/>
Please ensure your Excel file is formatted accordingly for optimal results. Enjoy exploring your literature review!
