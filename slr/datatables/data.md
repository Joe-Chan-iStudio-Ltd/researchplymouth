# Interactive Literature Reviews with DataTables

This page provides a powerful, searchable experience for exploring systematic literature reviews, powered by DataTables.  Your Excel file will be processed directly in your browser, ensuring confidentiality.  Research Plymouth does not retrieve or store your data; the Excel file stays entirely within your browser.

To get started, load your Excel worksheet.  The page will automatically process the first sheet of your file, following a simple structure:

*   Row 1: Flexible column headers (required). Suggested columns: Author, Year, Abstract, and Keyword.
*   Row 2 (Optional): Column widths (integers) to customize the table's appearance.  For optimal results, the column widths should sum to 100.
*   Remaining Rows: Your data.
